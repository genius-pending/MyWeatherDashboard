# WeatherDashboard
A colourful weather dashboard made using API integration, CSS, HTML,Javascript,Jquery,Moments.JS.
I enjoyed making this app but it was also difficult as this was the first time I have worked with api's, I learnt a valuable lesson in reading the API documentation lol.
I implemented template literals which is something new I discovered and will start using more of in my code going forward.
I enjoyed creating this as it combined all the technolgies used in front end development.
My only gripe is when I put in Birmingham it comes up with Birmingham Alabama not Birmingham UK :-( but I can sort that out another day lol.
